PURPOSE

This component reads a srcML file and creates a HashMap<String, List<String>> representing the call graph.  The key in the map is the fully qualified name of the method.  The value is a list of strings, where each item in the list is a fully qualified name of a method that the key method calls.

This component requires the subject program to have already been parsed into srcML.  SrcML is available for several platforms here:
http://www.srcml.org/

For example:
  $ srcml prog.java
Or for several files:
  $ srcml prog_src_directory
